  Reflexive ring and field tactics for Mathematical Components

description: |-
  This library provides `ring` and `field` tactics for Mathematical Components,
  that work with any `comRingType`s and `fieldType`s, respectively. Their
  instance resolution is done through canonical structure inference. Therefore,
  they work with abstract rings and do not require `Add Ring` and `Add Field`
  commands. Another key feature of this library is that they automatically push
  down ring morphisms to leaves of ring and field expressions before
  normalization to the Horner form.

  ## Credits
  The way we adapt internals of Coq's `ring` and `field` tactics to algebraic
  structures of the Mathematical Components library is inspired by the
  [elliptic-curves-ssr](https://github.com/strub/elliptic-curves-ssr) library by
  Evmorfia-Iro Bartzia and Pierre-Yves Strub.
