  Ring, field, lra, nra, and psatz tactics for Mathematical Components

description: |-
  This library provides `ring`, `field`, `lra`, `nra`, and `psatz` tactics for
  algebraic structures of the Mathematical Components library. The `ring` and
  `field` tactics respectively work with any `comRingType` and `fieldType`. The
  other (Micromega) tactics work with any `realDomainType` or `realFieldType`.
  Their instance resolution is done through canonical structure inference.
  Therefore, they work with abstract rings and do not require `Add Ring` and
  `Add Field` commands. Another key feature of this library is that they
  automatically push down ring morphisms and additive functions to leaves of
  ring/field expressions before applying the proof procedures.

  ## Caveat

  The `lra`, `nra`, and `psatz` tactics are considered experimental features and
  subject to change.

  ## Credits

  - The adaptation of the `lra`, `nra`, and `psatz` tactics is contributed by
    Pierre Roux.
  - The way we adapt the internal lemmas of Coq's `ring` and `field` tactics to
    algebraic structures of the Mathematical Components library is inspired by
    the [elliptic-curves-ssr](https://github.com/strub/elliptic-curves-ssr)
    library by Evmorfia-Iro Bartzia and Pierre-Yves Strub.
  - The example [`from_sander.v`](examples/from_sander.v) contributed by Assia
    Mahboubi was given to her by [Sander Dahmen](http://www.few.vu.nl/~sdn249/).
    It is related to a computational proof that elliptic curves are endowed with
    a group law.
    As [suggested](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00129237v4/document) by Laurent
    Théry a while ago, this problem is a good benchmark for proof systems.
    Laurent Théry and Guillaume Hanrot [formally
    verified](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-74591-4_24) this property in Coq
    in 2007.
